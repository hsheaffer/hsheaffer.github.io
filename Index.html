					<p>After graduating high school at Fort Zumwalt East High, I attended Lindenwood University in the Fall of 2011. I took all of my courses at Lindenwood and graduated with my Bachelorâ€™s of Arts in Elementary Education in 2016. My journey continued by becoming a teacher's assistant in the Kirkwood School District. Then, I became a substitute for a variety of school districts throughout the Saint Louis area. <br /> I landed a more permanent job in the Orchard Farms School District as a long term substitute and then as a building substitute for the remainder of the school year. During my employment with Orchard Farms, I completed my Early Childhood certification as well. Before accepting my first and current teaching job in the Hazelwood School District, I taught at a KinderCare center for a year and helped them become an accredited center before moving on.</p>
