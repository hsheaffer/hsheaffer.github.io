     Hello, my name is Hilary Sheaffer. I am a first grade educator in the Hazelwood School District. I graduated with my Bachelorâ€™s in Elementary Education in 2016. I received my degree from Lindenwood University in Saint Charles, Missouri. I am a mom to three girls and a bonus boy ages 3, 7, 11, and 12. We live in the Saint Louis area with my husband, 2 dogs, and cat. I have recently switched my degree from Early Childhood Special Education to Learning Technologies.  As the youngest member of the first grade team, I was looked to for many answers throughout the school year. I also was given the challenge of creating interactive and engaging lessons for our phonics program, Fundations. The students and my fellow educators enjoyed what I came up with and we utilized it for the rest of the school year successfully.
