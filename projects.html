<p>Project One-Behavior Management Method for Virtual Students: During the 2020-21 pandemic school year, we had to be creative in various ways throughout the school day to keep kids engaged during class time. One of the tools that I used was a virtual marble jar. Each student had their own jar and I allowed them up to 3 marbles a day based on participation. When they reached 30 marbles, the students were allowed to choose from a list of rewards and then the marble jar was “emptied” in order to start again.</p>

<p>Project Two-Home to School Communication: After doing research for a class last Summer on Classroom Technologies, I found that ClassTag was my favorite platform to use when communicating with parents. It kept track of all messages between the teacher and the parents, it also had a directory of all of the parents/guardians that was easily accessible. It also was a great way to announce new updates and upcoming events because the announcement would go straight to the guardian’s email or phone.</p>

<p>Project Three-Adapting Curriculum to Virtual Learning: The pandemic also made us get creative with curriculum that is supposed to be taught in person. I created these interactive Google Slides in order to make that happen for our first graders. Fundations is a full body learning approach to phonics, which is very hard to do virtually so I came up with these interactive slides AND incorporated some of the simpler body movements so the students were engaged and their participation was high. </p>
