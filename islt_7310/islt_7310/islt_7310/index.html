I am Hilary Sheaffer and I am hoping that by the end of this introduction you will learn what you need to know about me in order to move forward in this process.</h1>
<main><p>The purpose of this website is to highlight my strengths and assets that would qualify me as a good fit for the position needing to be filled. My goals are to spark interest in my application by providing a unique and modern layout, and encourage the employer to reach out with any further questions they may have about my experiences. In my professional portfolio, I will provide a quick background of my education and training. Then, a brief description of my strengths in the educational field and how they would benefit the team. Next, I will provide a glimpse into how I am continuing my education and training in order to grow alongside my students and peers. I will then finish this portfolio with an updated list of my work experiences and any contact information you may need in order to reach out to me.</p>
