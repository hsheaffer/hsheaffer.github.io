 <h2>A Little About Me</h2>
 <p>Happy Weekend Everyone, I am Hilary Sheaffer and I am a first grade teacher. First and foremost, I am a mom to 3 girls and a bonus boy, needless to say, we have a busy home. I atteneded Lindenwood University a year after high school and the birth of my oldest daughter. I am one of the strange ones that thoroughly enjoyed virtual teaching during the 2020 school year. So much so that I switched my Master's from Early Childhood to Learning Technologies. <br /> Between school, "mom-ing", working, and everything else, my favorite past time is coloring and walking at the lake.</p>
